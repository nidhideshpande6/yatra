    <p>Water parks which emerge from spas tend to more closely resemble mountain resorts, as they become year-round destinations. For example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the community's destination appeal</p>

The company employed over 13,000 people in the year 2010.[6][7]
Concurrently with the expansion of its luxury hotel chain in the major metropolitan cities, the Dream Group also expanded its business hotels division in the major metropolitan and large secondary cities in India. During the 1990s, the Dream Group continued to expand its geographic and market coverage in India. It developed specialized operations (such as wildlife lodges) and consolidated its position in established markets through the upgrading of existing properties and development of new properties. Dream also set up the Dream Kerala Hotels and Resorts Limited in the early 1990s along with the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation.[10]</p>
